# Knowledge-Graph-Engineering

Project
Discovery of the ecological relations between members of the microbiome via co-occurrence analysis and large-scale integration of multiple datasets.

Intro on Project
The microorganisms composing a microbial community, or microbiome, interact with each other and respond to external perturbations, making up various ecological relationships. These relationships can then impact the presence and abundance of certain species in the microbiome. For example, species can compete with each other for nutrients or can work together, with one exploiting the metabolites produced by the other. These interactions can be easily mapped to an interaction network.

Obejctive
The purpose of this project is to engineer a Knowledge Graph that can provide novel information about the interactions and relationships of these microorganisms in different diseases that span cohorts from all over the world, exploiting the curatedMetagenomicData R package. The cMD resource provides microbiome profiles from publicly available metagenomic studies from different studies, each investigating different diseases. The microbiome profiles of each study can be considered separately and the integration across multiple studies can be done afterwards exploiting the KG. The goal of the project is to build a KG starting from the relative abundance values of microbial species reported in the cMD resource that can expand the knowledge on the role of the microbiome in human diseases.
